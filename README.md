# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-python
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. This repository demonstrates some common exploratory data analysis methods and techniques using python.  
Two datasets of Covid-19 taken from Kaggle are analyzed. Through the analysis, we uncovered the answers of many interesting questions and get more insights on the dynamics of the pandemics.

## DataSet Overview
